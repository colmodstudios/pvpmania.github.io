        <h1>Privacy Policy for Pvpmania</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 23, 2025</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Colmod ("we," "us," or "our") handles information related to your use of the "Pvpmania" game. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring a safe gaming experience. We primarily rely on third-party services like PlayFab for account management and certain game functionalities. This policy outlines what information these services may process on our behalf, why they process it, and your rights concerning that information.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Do Not Directly Collect or Store</h2>
        <p>Colmod, as the game developer, does not directly collect, store, or process personal information from you. We have structured Pvpmania to minimize direct collection of your personal data.</p>

        <h2>2. Information Processed by Third-Party Services (PlayFab)</h2>
        <p>To provide core game functionalities, Pvpmania integrates with PlayFab, a backend platform for live games. PlayFab processes certain information on our behalf to enable features like account creation, player authentication, and security services (e.g., banning).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Information PlayFab may process:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account in Pvpmania, PlayFab handles this process. This may include identifiers such as a unique player ID generated by PlayFab, and potentially an associated email address if provided by you for account recovery or notifications.</li>
                    <li><strong>IP Addresses:</strong> PlayFab may use your IP address for account creation, to manage connections to their services, and for security purposes, including identifying and banning players who violate terms of service.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gameplay Data:</strong> Information about your in-game progress, statistics, and other gameplay activities may be stored by PlayFab to enable game functionality (e.g., saving your progress, leaderboards). This data is typically associated with your PlayFab player ID.</li>
                    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Basic information about the device you use to play Pvpmania (e.g., operating system, device type) may be processed by PlayFab for compatibility and service delivery.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Purpose of Processing by PlayFab:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>To enable account creation and management for Pvpmania.</li>
                    <li>To provide essential game services, such as player authentication, saving game progress, and supporting multiplayer functionality.</li>
                    <li>To enhance game security, detect, and prevent fraudulent activity or violations of our End-User License Agreement (EULA), including the ability to ban players.</li>
                    <li>To provide notifications to your account, including sending emails for updates or important game information.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>PlayFab's Privacy Policy:</strong>
                <p>The processing of data by PlayFab is governed by their own privacy policy. We encourage you to review their policy for detailed information on how they handle data. You can typically find their privacy policy on the PlayFab website.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
        <p>While we do not directly store your personal information, we rely on PlayFab's robust security measures to protect the data they process on our behalf. PlayFab is responsible for implementing technical and organizational measures designed to protect the information they handle against unauthorized access, loss, or disclosure.</p>

        <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Pvpmania is designed without content (e.g., blood splatter, explicit sounds) that would be considered inappropriate for children. However, we do not knowingly collect personal information directly from children without parental consent. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us (via PlayFab) with personal information without your consent, please contact us at the email address below.</p>
        <p>In South Africa, a "child" is defined as a person under the age of 18. We encourage parents and guardians to monitor their children's online activity and advise them on how to interact with online services and share personal information safely.</p>

        <h2>5. Your Rights (South Africa - POPIA)</h2>
        <p>As a data subject in South Africa, you have certain rights regarding your personal information under the Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA), even when processed by third parties on our behalf. These rights may include:</p>
        <ul>
