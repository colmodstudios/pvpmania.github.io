        <h2>II. Third-Party Licensed Content &amp; Technologies</h2>
        <p>"Pvpmania" incorporates various third-party materials and technologies, which are used under their respective licenses. Colmod acknowledges and respects the intellectual property rights of these third parties.</p>

        <h3>A. Game Engine:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Unity Game Engine:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Used under the terms of the Unity Technologies Terms of Service and End User License Agreement (EULA). Colmod adheres to the licensing requirements as specified by Unity Technologies, which may include revenue-based tiers for commercial distribution.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="note"><em>Action for Colmod: Regularly review Unity's updated Terms of Service (especially for 2025) to ensure continued compliance with their licensing models (e.g., Unity Runtime Fee if applicable, or changes to subscription tiers). Keep records of your Unity license type (e.g., Personal, Plus, Pro, Enterprise).</em></div>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B. Unity Asset Store Content:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Background Art (from Unity Asset Store):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Licensing Type:</strong> <span class="action-required">[ACTION REQUIRED: Specify the exact license type for EACH asset. Most are under the Unity Asset Store EULA, but some may have custom licenses. Example: "Standard Unity Asset Store EULA".]</span></li>
                    <li><strong>Attribution:</strong> <span class="action-required">[ACTION REQUIRED: If attribution is required by the asset's specific license, state it here precisely as required.

                <div class="note"><em>Action for Colmod: Go through every single Unity Asset Store asset you used. For each, confirm its specific license terms on its product page. If custom, link to it. If standard, note it. If attribution is required, record the exact wording needed and where it should be displayed (e.g., in-game credits).</em></div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Promotional Materials (from Unity Asset Store):</strong>

        </ul>

        <h3>C. Game Music &amp; Sound Effects:</h3>

                <ul>

                <div class="note"><em>Action for Colmod: This is your highest priority. Re-download or meticulously trace each sound effect to its original source.

Replace problematic assets with clearly licensed "royalty-free" assets (paid or free with clear commercial use licenses) from reputable audio libraries like FreeSound (filtering by commercial-use licenses), Mixkit, Epidemic Sound, etc. Keep a detailed spreadsheet of every sound effect, its source URL, and its license.</em></div>

        <h2>III. End-User License Agreement (EULA) for Pvpmania</h2>

            <li>

                    <li>(a) Sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, distribute, or otherwise transfer "Pvpmania" or any rights to it.</li>
                    <li>(b) Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of "Pvpmania," except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation.</li>

                    <li>(g) Attempt to gain unauthorized access to any servers, accounts, or networks connected to "Pvpmania."</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>3. Ownership:</strong> Colmod retains all right, title, and interest in and to "Pvpmania," including all copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights. This EULA grants You a limited license to use the game, not an ownership interest in "Pvpmania."</li>
            <li><strong>4. Disclaimers of Warranty:</strong> "Pvpmania" is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, express or implied. Colmod does not warrant that "Pvpmania" will be uninterrupted or error-free.</li>
            <li><strong>5. Limitation of Liability:</strong> To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Colmod shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (a) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the game; (b) any conduct or content of any third party on the game; (c) any content obtained from the game; and (d) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content.</li>

Your rights under this EULA will terminate immediately and automatically without notice from Colmod if you fail to comply with any of its terms and conditions. Upon termination, you must cease all use of "Pvpmania" and destroy all copies thereof.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>IV. Important South African Copyright Considerations for 2025:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Automatic Protection:</strong> In South Africa, copyright protection for your original works (code, art, music you create) is automatic from the moment of creation, provided it's in a material form. You don't <em>need</em> to register it for protection to exist.</li>
            <li><strong>Registration Benefits (South Africa):</strong> While not mandatory, registering your copyright with the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC) can offer benefits, particularly in a dispute. It provides official proof of ownership and can simplify enforcement. For software, copyright protects the <em>expression</em> (your code), not the underlying idea or functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Copyright Amendment Bill:</strong> As of early 2025, the Copyright Amendment Bill in South Africa is still undergoing review and has faced constitutional challenges, particularly regarding its "fair use" provisions. This bill aims to modernize copyright law. <strong>It's important to monitor its final enactment and implications</strong>, but for now, rely on the existing Copyright Act of 1978 and its established principles of "fair dealing" (which is more restrictive than "fair use"). Your game's commercial nature means you generally need explicit permission or appropriate licenses for third-party content, not relying on "fair use" exceptions.</li>
            <li><strong>Trademark for Game Title/Logo:</strong> For "Pvpmania" and "Colmod Logo," consider applying for trademark registration with CIPC. This protects your brand names and logos specifically for goods/services (like video games) and prevents others from using confusingly similar marks. Copyright protects the <em>artwork</em> of the logo, but trademark protects the <em>brand identity</em>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Next Steps for You, Colmod:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Strict License Audit:</strong> This is the most crucial part. Go through every non-original asset (especially sound effects and Unity Asset Store items). Find the exact license for <em>each one</em>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you find a sound effect that says "Non-Commercial" (NC), you <strong>cannot use it in a game you sell or monetize</strong>.</li>
                    <li>If you find one with "Share-Alike" (SA) and you modify it, you might be forced to license your <em>entire game</em> under that same restrictive license.</li>
                    <li>Aim for Public Domain (CC0), CC BY, or standard royalty-free commercial licenses.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Credits Page:</strong> As you identify licenses that require attribution, compile a "Credits" or "Acknowledgements" page within your game (or its main menu/documentation) where you list these attributions precisely as required by each license.</li>
            <li><strong>Implement EULA:</strong> Decide how you will present the EULA to your players (e.g., click-through acceptance during installation, prominent link on your website/store page, accessible from within the game).</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Legal Consultation (Strongly Recommended):</strong> Given the complexities, especially around the South African Copyright Amendment Bill and ensuring your EULA is robust for your specific game and monetization plans, I cannot stress enough the value of consulting with a South African intellectual property lawyer. They can:
                <ul>
                    <li>Review your asset list and confirm licensing validity.</li>
                    <li>Help you draft an EULA tailored to your game and compliant with SA law.</li>
                    <li>Advise on trademark registration for "Pvpmania" and "Colmod."</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
